## Gameplay
* Runs on Linux and Web (PC and Mobile)
* Avoid hitting falling spikes and the cave walls
* The cave gets harder to move around in as you progress
* 3 difficulty levels

## Controls
There are two control modes: keyboard mode and touch mode. Touch mode also works with the mouse, but keyboard is recommended on PC. You can change the control mode in Options.
* Use WASD or arrow keys to move around. Going below the map will kill you.
* In touch mode, tapping on the screen will move you to that position. In a way, this is easier than keyboard controls, so the game is faster to make up for that.
* If the level is impossible (the cave is steeper than the player movement speed, shouldn't happen in most cases), you can press R to generate a new level. This will reset your score and lives.
* Press ESC to go to the main menu.
* Press B in game to open the debug screen. In touch mode, there is a link in Options.
* Press G to quickly toggle low/high graphics.
* Whatever you do, don't press T when in game.
